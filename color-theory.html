    </div>

    <div class="post">
        <p>This piece focuses around a presentation I gave in class about the importance of colour theory and how to apply it properly in UX design. I go through the parameters of colours, such as hue, tint and shades, and then describe different color palettes and important design matters regarding these. Please find the presentation slides <a target ="_blank" href="pieces/CS3240 UX Colour.pdf" download>here</a>.  <br>
        <br>
        In my presentation, I talk mainly about the approaches and importance of knowing both your brand and your audience when choosing colours for design. In the gallery below you will find one of my sources in my slides, which is a colour emotion guide which I touched upon when talking about the concept of building a brand identity through colour. <br><br>
        To aid in this, it is important to know common color schemes, which I covered extensively in my presentation, from definition to possible applications. I wrapped up the presentation by showcasing an example website and how they properly apply colour design to improve their design. In addition to all this, I breifly researched the importance between choosing RGB and CMYK colour bases, however I decided not to include this in my presentation as it was already lengthy enough, however, feel free to check the image about it on the gallery below!

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            My main motivation behind researching this topic is simply that I find how designers manage to blend colours together fascinating. The fact that there is a whole field dedicated to the study of how to compose colours together to achieve different effects is very attractive to me, so when given the chance to make a presentation for the class, this felt like a natural choice to make. I believe that this topic is usually not very obvious to many people, mainly due to the fact that good design almost always is not noticeable, it just simply blends in. I think I was able to give a nice presentation about it and the class were interested by the contents of my talk, so it was a good learning experience for me and them.

    <h3> Gallery</h3>
    <p>Here I showcase some of the most interesting findings and main concepts I talked about (more details on my presentation and in the actual slides) </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Colour emotion guide. This chart depicts a really key factor in colour theory, which is choosing your colours. As seen, its no coincidence that many brands share similar colours when related to a specific field (e.g nature = green). There is great value in understanding what colours you chose in both a visual and psychological level and designers should be aware of this!</li>
        <li>
            Colour schemes are the key concept to takeaway from my presentation. This tool is not supposed to be an end all and limit the freedom of designers (in fact I covered some examples that work best by braking some of the usual rules on the slides), but simply as a guidance tool to help choose a nice array of colours to use for your designs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, I would like to briefly touch on a topic I chose not to cover in the presentation material, the difference between RGB and CMYK during the choice of colour. Due to the nature of the course (CS undergrad) most people dont have to worry about the CMYK scheme and the RGB scheme, as RGB is the usual go to in this field. However, it was something I thought would be nice to highlight in this write up. See the image for a brief explanation on the two schemes!
